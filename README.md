# video-dl
A frontend UI for yt-dlp

## Requirements

- This has mostly been tested with python 3.12.0 on Windows 10.  In theory, it is cross-platform and should work with any OS and any somewhat recent version of Python 3.

	- Additionally, there may be some cosmetic issues with the UI if using a python version below 3.10.
	
- yt-dlp

	- yt-dlp needs to be installed for this to work.  I chose not to bundle it because yt-dlp is updated quite often to ensure compatibility with different video sites.
	
	- You should keep yt-dlp up to date to get the best results.  For testing, yt-dlp version 2023.12.30 was used.
